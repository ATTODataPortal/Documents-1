## 2 News

Here you find all important up-to-date information on restrictions
regarding plot access. Please check this page before your field trip.

## 3 Calendar

The calendar shows reserved resources or bookings to give an orientation
for BE-members and LMTS about planned and ongoing fieldwork.

### 3.1 View option in the fieldwork calendar

The fieldwork calendar shows per default all reserved resources of the
actual week (Figure 2). Areas, equipment, and sleeping places are called
resources. All resources that are reserved together form one booking.
This can be one field trip or even all field trips of the season
together. Use filer (Table 1) and view options (Table 2) to get a good
overview of reservations.
