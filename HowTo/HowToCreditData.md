## 1 How to cite a dataset

We suggest the following form:

`List of data creators separated by semicolons (Creation date): Title. Dataset version with a leading "v". Publisher, which is Biodiversity Exploratories Information System. Type of resource, which is "Dataset". For internal data: URL of the repository, which is "https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/". ID of the dataset with a leading "Dataset ID ="  / For public data: URL or DOI of the dataset.`

**Example internal data:** Fischer, Markus; R. Bolliger; D. Schäfer; N. Hölzel; M. Freitag; D. Prati; V. Klaus (2018): Vegetation Records for Grassland SADE, 2015 - 2018. v3. Biodiversity Exploratories Information System. Dataset. https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/. Dataset ID=24006.

**Example public data:** Fischer, Markus; R. Bolliger; D. Schäfer; N. Hölzel; M. Freitag; D. Prati; V. Klaus (2018): Vegetation Records for Grassland SADE, 2015 - 2018. v3. Biodiversity Exploratories Information System. Dataset. https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/ddm/data/Showdata/24006.

(We will provide a citation string within the dataset download package in the future.)

## 2 How to make a data availability statement

We suggest the following statement:

> This work is based on data elaborated by [a project / several projects] of the Biodiversity Exploratories program (DFG Priority Program 1374). The datasets are publicly available in the Biodiversity Exploratories Information System (http://doi.org/10.17616/R32P9Q), (**xxx**). 
>
> **xxx:** List of URLs or DOIs of the public available datasets 

Should there be data that cannot be published immediately, please add the following statement to the sentence above:

> However, to give data owners and collectors time to perform their analysis the Biodiversity Exploratories' data and publication policy includes by default an embargo period of three years from the end of data collection/data assembly which applies to the remaining datasets (IDs: **yyy**). These datasets will be made publicly available via the same data repository.
>
> **yyy:** List of IDs from internal datasets
