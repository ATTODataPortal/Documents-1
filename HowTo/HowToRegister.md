## 1 Registration

The registration form is accessible via the *Register* button on the
right side. All fields of the form are mandatory and it is required to
agree to the *Terms and Conditions* and the *Privacy Policy* (Figure 1).
Then you will be asked to confirm your email address. In the last step,
you have to provide some information (e.g., name, affiliation to the
project, organization). Based on this information, the BExIS Team will
grant permissions for BEXIS2 within three days.

## 2 Login

Click the *Login* button on the right side (Figure 2). Then enter your
email or user name and password. If the login is successful, the start
page (*News* or *Search*) is loaded. Otherwise, you will see information
about the status and reason for the failed login.

## 3 API Token

In general, two mechanisms, authentication and authorization protect the
APIs of BEXIS2. Unlike logon, which uses the usual credentials, the APIs
use a personalized token for authentication. The token can be found in
the user menu.
